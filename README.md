# Experimental BitTorrent/IPFS implementation

This repository contains a collection of experimental code written to explore
existing P2P technologies and possible enhancements, with a particular focus on
IPFS. It includes (very incomplete) implementations of BitTorrent, IPFS, TLS,
and QUIC.

At this point, none of the code is directly useful for anything. It is intended
to eventually become a combined BitTorrent/IPFS implementation designed for
scalability, efficiency, and low-memory usage.
